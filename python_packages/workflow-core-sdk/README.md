# workflow-core-sdk

Shared core SDK for the workflow engine. This package will host the execution engine, execution context, step registry, shared models, clients, and utilities used by both orchestration and the lightweight execution runtime.

Initial skeleton only; implementations will be extracted from workflow-engine-poc in subsequent steps.
