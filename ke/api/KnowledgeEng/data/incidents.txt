Incident Subject: Config not being pushed to Firewall from Panorama.



Incident Description: Commit failed to firewall.



Additional Context: For some users, the configuration changes made on Panorama is not able to push onto the managed devices.

But the configuration should be able to push to managed devices.

Checking for any local changes and also templates and device groups while pushing will help to get to the cause.

Incident Subject:  Lost connectivity towards USCAFREPANFW01 and USCAFREPANFW02



Incident Description: We had lost connectivity towards USCAFREPANFW01;USCAFREPANFW02. We are unable to ping these Palo Alto Firewalls, unable to connect with CLI or GUI.

We needed to to do HA-Failover and when we suspended USCAFREPANFW02 node for HA state, we had lost connection towards both of the nodes.

Panorama was also showing connection status as 'Disconnected' towards both of the nodes.

Incident happened around 2023-04-24 at 1:30 a.m to 2:15 a.m

We would like to have RCA and eventually fix the issue caused by HA failover.



Additional Context: This scenario has an HA-Pair which is managed by Panorama. When tried to failover from the primary to the secondary Firewall both the Firewalls went down and shows disconnected from Panorama. Although an HA-Failover should be failed over to a secondary Firewall without any issues.

Incident Subject:  SSL/TLS profile for GP portal



Incident Description: Team, we are in the process of setting up the GP portal on Prisma for our enterprise users along with a breakglass/backup portal on our on-prem firewalls.

While setting up the backup portal, we received a scan report stating that TLSv1.2(used for min supported TLS version) is a weak/insecure cipher to be used for handshake/auth.



Even though its a default feature and palo supports 1.3 when set to Max or selected manually under Max supported version for the TLS profile, is there any way to mitigate this vul. or to strengthen the security/ciphers used for the portal handshake?



Additional Context: Customer Needs the recommendation to disable the following weak ciphers from the  tlsv1.2 version on palo and its impact doing so.:



<li>TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA</li>

<li>TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CB

Incident Subject: Active device in cluster stoped processing traffic



Incident Description: Yesterday around 12-1pm ETC time our active device stopped processing traffic properly. Probably after a commit. However when we did a failover manually (the automatic failover didn't work as no link were down according to active device) everything started to work normally. So either there was an issue with the commit process itself or there is something wrong with the hardware. Tech Support reports attached.



Additional Context: All the traffic toward Internet stopped working suddenly through active FW after a commit change was done. But started working normally after a manual fail-over.

Incident Subject: GlobalProtect Clientless VPN: apps not visible after upgrade to 10.2.x



Incident Description: Following the upgrade from PAN-OS 10.1.x to 10.2.4, and successful authentication to GP Portal, all the Clientless apps are missing.

Tried to:

#1. modify the configuration and Commit

#2. revert to GP Clientless VPN v96-240, delete v97-245, re-download and re-install it



Checked Traffic, Threat and URL Filtering logs, no issue nor anomaly detected.

In the System Logs getting a "Informational" message:

gpsvc: connection to authd is broken while reading, read unixgram @/tmp/authd_client_GP_socket_1681062596.sock->@/tmp/authd.sock: use of closed network connection time: 2023-04-09 17:55:34.



Reading the PAN-OS v10.2 RN, noticed a "PAN-195713. Fixed an issue where clientless VPN applications were not displayed in the GlobalProtect portal page". Apparently this was a bug, fixed in current version.



Additional Context: Since the upgrade to 10.2.4 all users are affected which are running in existing configuration. According to the release notes this issue where clientless VPN applications were not displayed on the GlobalProtect portal page is fixed but still don't observe the expected behavior.

Disk Pair B Unavailable

Status Disk mount failure

 In the raid.log we are getting the below error.

" ERROR: mounting the Disk Pair B failed with ret mount: /opt/panlogs/ld2: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/md2, missing codepage or helper program, or other error."

login to the root of this log-collector and run the below command

run "e2fsck -n /dev/md2"

run "resize2fs -f /dev/md2" After that we rebooted the log collector. But still, we are getting the same error in the "show system raid detail".

Incident Subject: Problems to reach DNS server from MGT Interface



Incident Description:

We hace an active/passive HA cluster with a pair of 3250 running on PAN-OS 10.1.6-H6,

This traffic goes from MGT interface towards a layer 3 device passing through another layer 3 device and finally arriving to the data-plane to be parsed.

We have an issue when configuring a DNS server 10.240.1.2 under Device > Services on the firewall, it cannot ping or trace that DNS server from the MGT interface 192.168.181.10, it shoud be noted that we have service routes for kerberos en dns services, nonetheless the firewall should reach the DNS server from the MGT interface

Although we have service routes for the server 10.240.1.2 as Kerberos and DNS, the issue only occurs when the server 10.240.1.2 is defined as DNS server. If we change this DNS server for example using 10.240.1.5 instead, the firewall can now ping or trace to 10.240.1.2, but not 10.240.1.5.

This communication issue needs to be fixed because the secondary firewall can't reach the kerberos server from the data-plane thanks to its passive role, and we want to delete the services routes on both firewalls.



Additional Context: Communication between the DNS server and the firewall using its MGT interface is failing.
