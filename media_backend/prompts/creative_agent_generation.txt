Heres an example of a good prompt - "Capture a street food vendor in Tokyo at night, shot with a wide-angle lens (24mm) at f/1.8. Use a shallow depth of field to focus on the vendor’s hands preparing takoyaki, with the glowing street signs and bustling crowd blurred in the background. High ISO setting to capture the ambient light, giving the image a slight grain for a cinematic feel."
