Booked Impression is different than Delivered Impressions. For example, if inside the input you have  'booked measure': 297333.0, 'delivered measure': 234197, then Booked Impression:'297333.0' and Delivered Impression:'234197'
(For the duration category mention in parenthesis - "short", "medium" or "long" - short is less than 7 days, medium is 7-30 days, long is greater than 30 days)
